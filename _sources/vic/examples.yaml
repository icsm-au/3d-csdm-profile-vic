- title: VIC Extended Example
  content: |-
    PS914576X: Three lot subdivision of Crown Portion 16 (PT), Parish of Cut-Paw-Paw.  Consists of 26 Boundary Marks, 
    nine Cadastral Marks, five Geodetic Reference Marks and five Occupation Marks. There are 39 total Station 
    observations, three GNSS observations, and 15 derived observation. The dataset includes five primary parcels (three 
    new, one to be extinguished, and an aggregate parcel representing the Owners Corporation. There are two secondary 
    (easements) parcels.  The dataset includes occupation features, supporting documents, and a number of annotations.

    Contains a **single 2D Building parcel**, Lot 2, plus **14 SurveyMarks** that define the extent of the parcel, **6

    or the middle of the wall on the boundary. Together, the **14 vectorObservations** defining the 14 boundaries 
    (Bearing & Distance). **14 observedVectors** describing the 14 boundary line geometries.

    Contains **five Primary Parcels**, Lots 1 to 3, the parent parcel (to be extinguished), and an **Aggregate Parcel** 
    representing the Owners Corporation created over Lots 1 to 3. There are **two Easements**, Areas E1 and E2. Dataset 
    also includes **22 SurveyMarks** that define the extent of the primary and secondary parcels, 
    **26 vectorObservations** defining the 26 boundaries (Bearing & Distance), and **26 observedVectors** describing the 
    26 boundary line geometries.  The **2 Secondary Parcels** describe both conventional Easements (**1**) and easements 
    in Gross (**2**), with a total of **4 Interests** described.

- title: VIC Annotation Example
  content: |-
    Contains 10 annotation examples that may be included on the plan face of a conventional VIC Deposited Plan or in an 
    ePlan LandXML dataset. The data for this example is same data used for the VIC Secondary Parcel example. In some 
    instances the annotation relates to a specific parcel or parcels. In those cases, the annotation instance includes a 
    **references** element that lists the ID(s) of the parcel(s) that the annotation refers to.

- title: VIC Occupation Example
  content: |-
    Includes the same dataset for the VIC Secondary Parcel Example above plus 2 additional **GeodeticReferenceMarks**, 
    three **CadastralMarks**, and five **OccupationMarks** fixing two firewalls between three dwelling units. Relevant 
    **observedVectors** and **vectorObservations** have also been included. The diagram displays two of the survey 
    measurements to **OccupationMarks** at the front of the buildings. The firewalls are shown on the boundaries between 
    dwelling 1 and 2, and 2 and 3. The building footprints (minus the firewalls) are shown inbetween, and are included 
    in the **OccupationFeatures**. The occupation marks **touch** corners of the fire walls. The boundary lines on or 
    within the fire walls include comments indicating if the boundary is the face of the firewall or the midline.
